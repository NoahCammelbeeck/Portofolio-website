            In this project we created an intro sequence. We worked with video editing and planning shots. Our group decided on basing our video on
            Sex and the City's intro, so part of our work was also analysing some of the shots and techniques used for thar. Besides the intro
            sequence, we were also taught techniques for generating ideas and introduced to some of the tools we are using now, fx. Figma.
          </p>
          <p>Besides the video editing, I also made the music used in the video.</p>

            Here we were introduced to coding in HTML and CSS. We also coded our first site, starting out with making it mobile first, and since then
            working the CSS into being friendlier towards wider screens. All content on the site were given to us by our teachers, so our work was in
            setting up and designing the site. We were also introduced to github.

            After T2, where we were introduced to HTML and CSS, we were thrown in deep, having to work on our own website of a topic of our own
            choice. I chose my topic to be the Dungeons and Dragons campaign I'm playing with players. Since I've made the world and story myself, I
            wanted the site to make it easier to find information about the campaign for my players.
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked with the site from the very beginning: starting with generating ideas for the site, brainstorming functionalities and design
            ideas, later making wireframes, mockups, lofi and hifi prototypes and at last implementing it all in code.

          <p>
            Unlike T3, we were given a theme for our website before hand: emergency! The emergency was however of our own choosing and I chose to make
            heist helper: a site for robbers, looking for help when their heist goes off script.
          </p>
          <p>
            The base of the site was given to us, so it was out job to work our ideas into it. To do this we used AI to create content. On my site all
            the articles (seen on the landing page's right side) are written with a chatbot. A few of the pictures on this page is also made with AI,
            firefly specifically. For this project we were also made to make a clickable infographic, which also were what I gave firefly as reference
            for generating pictures.
          </p>
          <p>
            To make the infographic work, we also dove into our first coding in JavaScript. With JavaScript I also made some detail work on my
            popovers, did a form for robbers in need of help, and a dark mode (including a toggle).

            This project was about directing all what we've learned throughout the semester towards a real world company. At first we worked by
            ourself, where I chose to work with the self help festival, Tribal Vibe. I did a rework of the index site, looking for where the user
            experince and interface could be optimized, while trying to keep the brand indentity intact.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later on, we were put into groups of four. Here we chose to work with the vintage shop Quriosa. We visited the current website, went to
            the shop and talked with its owner, Søren Falk, to distill what the brand of Quriosa is, and what functionalities Søren would like the
            site to have.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides the coding and designing of the website, a large part of this project was also working in a team. We worked with scrum and trello,
            to keep an overview of our project and its duration.
